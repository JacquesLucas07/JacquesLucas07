# 👋 Hey, I'm Lucas!

## Passionate Developer & Jack of All Trades

🎓 Student and developer navigating between Python, Rust, and tons of other technologies. I tinker with open source projects, learning Go, Docker, and Kubernetes, and trying not to get lost in the web dev universe with React and Flask.

💬 Trilingual (🇫🇷 native, 🇬🇧 B2, 🇷🇺 A2) because coding in multiple languages is great, but speaking multiple languages is even better!

🌟 I share my projects, my experiments (sometimes failed, often instructive), and I try to contribute to the dev community as best as I can.
